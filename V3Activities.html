				<h1>Tawa Menzshed</h1>
				<h2>
				Following a public meeting in October 2016, a group decided that a shed could be established in Tawa. Since then, we have 100 sq mtr available at the Wellington Rural Fire Force Building, 86 Oxford St, Tawa and have been in business since August 2017. 
				Unfortunately, the building is currently not accessible via our address, which is blocked by a condemned bridge. Please drive in via Davies Street, past the Tawa Swimming Pool and car parks, then head south along the drive to the Rural Fire Building. 
				We have up to 100 members already, and we are open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm.

				<h1>Pop up market</h1>
				<h2>
				New World shopping mall Address: 35 Oxford Street, Tawa, Wellington 5028 
				Description: A monthly Pop Up Market in Tawa selling quality, handcrafted and sourced goods. 
				Find us in the New World Atrium, with free parking close by, there is no excuse not to pop in & see what we have to offer. 
				Set up by two local mums with a passion for craft and design who saw a gap in the "market" to have a regular craft market in the Northern Suburbs. 
				From this vision, Tawa Pop Up Market was created. This initiative is seen as a community event involving local stallholders, businesses and schools and a way to showcase what Tawa has to offer.
